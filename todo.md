# New features
Some new planned features for Orion bot.

## Log analytics
Save analytics of using Orion bot on Discord. Saving to SQLite database and then exporting it to some analytics software.


## Funny unit conversions
Create some listeners to units in messages on Discord. Then units will be calculated to other weird units, like cars...

E.g. 100m will be transformed to something like => 100m is like 40 Skoda Fabia cars.
